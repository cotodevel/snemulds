special_nds_arm_ld_crt0.xxx in /arm9 uses ARM9 WRAM as a whole new section to run very fast data... like the ppu code!
snes rendering is going to be faster now.

notes 11/01/2018:

1)
For compatibility on older cards, the --no-gc-sections must be added (for both ARM7 and ARM9 NDS ARM Cores). Perhaps it's an issue with unaligned stubbed leftovers from
the building sessions. But hey, it's kept. 50~KB shouldn't matter much here.

2)
-O2 preferred as it cause issues/slower gameplay.

3)
Nifi works, but the multiplayer is not implemented. Todo

4)
The .ZIP routine is slow because I use a page buffer to decompress a portion of the file, and then it is written back. If the driver in your flashcard do not support DMA on writes
it will be slow. Be patient.

Coto.
