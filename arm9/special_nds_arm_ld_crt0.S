	@DS BIOS RAM Usage
	@Below memory at 27FFxxxh is mirrored to 23FFxxxh (on retail consoles with 4MB RAM), however, it should be accessed via address 27FFxxxh 
	@(for compatibility with debug consoles with 8MB RAM). Accessing it via mirrors at 2FFFxxxh is also valid (this is done by DSi enhanced games; 
	@even when running in non-DSi mode; this allows DSi games to use the same memory addresses in NDS and DSi mode).
	
	@Coto: vectors @ 0xffff0000 is bios area. Accidental undefined,dataabort,SWI,etc during MPU setup is expected. 
	@Thus, BIOS exceptions must be handled from such DS BIOS RAM stacks.
	
	@Also, MPU exceptions are triggered in USR mode (0x10&psr), SYS mode exceptions are ignored. (0x1f&psr)
	
	@disable exceptions when MPU setup. Enter SYS mode.
