//This file abstracts specific TGDS memory allocator code which allows for either default malloc or custom implementation malloc, by overriding this source code.

#include "posixHandleTGDS.h"

////////[For custom Memory Allocator implementation]:////////
//You need to override getProjectSpecificMemoryAllocatorSetup():
//After that, TGDS project initializes the default/custom allocator automatically.


	////////[Default Memory implementation is selected, thus stubs are implemented here]////////


//Definition that overrides the weaksymbol expected from toolchain to init ARM9's TGDS memory allocation
