NTR/TWL SDK: TGDS1.65

# SnemulDS 0.6d

master: Development branch. Use TGDS1.65: branch for stable features.
SnemulDS 0.6b Original Sources (because codebase itÂ´s not either 0.5 or 0.6a from snemuldsx source codes)... 
This is based from real 0.6.a sources archeide left years ago and I managed to find.

Stable Release: 
	- https://bitbucket.org/Coto88/SnemulDS/get/TGDS1.65.zip

Usage:
    - Download [Stable Release] and copy all files from /release/arm7dldi-[ntr/twl], snemul.cfg as well, in SD:/ root. [NDS] mode is for DS mode, and [TWL] for DSi mode. 
	  If it prompts for overwrite: Yes to All. 
    - Create a /snes folder in SD: root, and put your homebrew games on it
	- SPC Playback: Optionally, create a /spc folder in SD: root, and put your SPC files on it. You can choose and play a SPC File in the "SPC Jukebox" option. 
	- [NTR]: Now open loader (internal, hbmenu or other), and run ToolchainGenericDS-multiboot.nds. Then select SnemulDS.nds from the menu, choose ARG (A button) and select the snes file to run.
	- [TWL]: Now open TWiLightMenu (you must set it up first, so you can run TWL mode apps), and run ToolchainGenericDS-multiboot.srl. Then select SnemulDS.srl from the menu, choose ARG (A button) and select the snes file to run.

Gameboy Macro Mode:
	- Option selectable from the touchscreen User Interface. 
	
Save / Load States:
	- It is experimental. It may or not work. It's recommended to always save then restore a single state at a time.

Properly Saving / Loading SRAM:
	- Save in-game, check Options -> SRAM saving and wait for a "SRAM written" message to appear. 

Screen Sync (Vblank Enabled / Vblank Disabled):
	- If the game is running too fast, enable Vblank. Some specific games will need Vblank disabled.
	Vblank fast forces the emulator to draw a whole frame, preventing frameskips, but won't slow down to sync to NDS Vblank interrupts. (fixes TWL mode to match NTR mode rendering speed)
	Vblank full forces the emulator + NDS Vblank interrupt to draw a whole frame, preventing frameskips. Cause massive slowdown, even more in TWL mode due to ARM9i Vblank bug, but required for some games.
	
	Recommended setting is Vblank fast to get a smooth framerate while fast rendering.
	
TWL Mode:
	-SnemulDS TWL mode has extended memory (16MB), so games like Donkey Kong Country 3 are 100% beatable, but beware, save often as the game tends to crash sometimes.

Megaman X series are 100% beatable on DS/DSLite/DSi/3DS (TGDS1.65 branch):
	[DS Phat, DS Lite & DSi / 3DS]:
		- Megaman X1 on SnemulDS requires "Mega Man X (US) (v1.1)":
		MD5: 8998f2d66a84c1d44ab6387db7314efd
		SHA1: 404f160bbb1a5e9d3e0bfd38edaa448984040899
		SHA256: 152eb370f988b33291d2dddfc48abb42bfa236a08ddc7362e07dd2795e3e37d0
		SHA512: 8b7de3bfa15e192cb1fb5128cba64ef629813a1d3782c7f57dc2f93b0b06a1565aa256f60fa5b550a1241e8e536b18bb27d4e210937d4b4329739e2990136f0b
		
		- Megaman X2 and Megaman X3 are supported by default.
	
	-Megaman X3 Zero Project is compatible on SnemulDS TWL (DSi only) due to lack of RAM.

Changelog:

SnemulDS 0.6d:
	- Added CX4 co processor support! Megaman X2 / Megaman X3 it's entirely playable now. (tweak sprite priority settings if necessary)
	- fixed even more CPU bugs. This narrows down games not booting due to cross-boundary pages or to APU synchronization issues!
	
SnemulDS 0.6c:
	- fix TWL mode touchscreen!
	
SnemulDS 0.6c alpha:
	- TWL support! Currently tested on no&gba. Some lag may happen between loading screens. 
	- Fixed a ton of issues (a work of at least 3 years, related with TGDS SDK, mostly memory issues, codebase stability, interrupts, arm7 dldi support, arm7 sd twl support, etc)
	- Fixed codebase mostly to have a better user-experience, and of course all the changes were merged into NTR version as well.
	
SnemulDS 0.6b:
	- Fix compatibility with more cards, also restored compatibility to be the same as the one developed by Archeide.

SnemulDS 0.6a:
	- A ton of stuff. Add SnemulDS to TGDS. NTR mode only.

SnemulDS 0.6:
	- used old SnemulDSx sources, which were broken.

Known issues:
	-   Fix Mode 0 (no transparency/broken)

Many thanks to:

Archeide for the emulator & source code
Bubble2k for CPU core
Gladius for Sound Core
PeterLemon for CPU tests
